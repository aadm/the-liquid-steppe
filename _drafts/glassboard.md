It's been some time now that I have published a weekly roundup of some of my photographs. It was not supposed to be a collection of my best shots, or anything like that; it was more intended to have some space to put online what I think are 'interesting' photos, maybe photos that happen to be outside of specific contexts (travelogues, event-related pictures or thematic collections). It was also a way to stimulate some discussions with some of my friends that have an interest in photography.

Unfortunately we are all very busy. My blog does not allow comments. I had only a few feedbacks in reply to my mails. So the conversation is fading. I will still carry on doing this thing because I am a very solitary person and don't really need to be 'followed' to do stuff; if I have one skill is to be self-motivated.

It would be good to have a more passionate roundup of people, and I am not entirely convinced that it is the platform (email+blog posts) that sucks; however, leaving aside Facebook adn Twitter and Google+, I have found this interesting review of something which is like Facebook only it's not like Facebook at all. It's called [Glassboard](http://glassboard.com), it's an iPhone and Android app and also a web app, and Gabe Weatherhead has a [very good review](http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/08/glassboard-the-anti-facebook.html) which I invite you to read.

Reading through some blog posts I have found a very interesting story, about a [photo collective](http://www.stratacollective.com/) of 6 guys that use Glassboard for their things:

Is is something worth pursuing? Something that maybe will allow more participation from Daniele and Dylan and Danilo and all my other photopals?

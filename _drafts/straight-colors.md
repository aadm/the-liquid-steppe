It's an interesting question and Zack's response makes perfect sense. But in the case of VSCO I think a lot depends on how you actually use the presets.

When I decided to switch to Lightroom a few weeks ago, the first thing I did was buy the new VSCO Film 02 kit. But I used the presets more as a learning tool than a one click image enhancer. I've said this before but the fact that VSCO uses tools native to each application to achieve its film emulations (at least in the Standard versions without profiling) provides a great learning opportunity. It's very easy to analyze and retro-engineer the looks you like, make them suit your style and provide better starting points. So even though I almost never use the actual presets anymore, they served as a crash course in Lightroom processing.

As for the bigger question about dated looks: anything we do risks looking somewhat dated eventually. Sometimes it has nothing to do with processing, just how we light or shoot. But I think it's a lot worse if you stick to extremes, stuff like Instagram filters or the Twilight look which are already starting to feel like neon-lit 80's stuff. In the case of VSCO it's very easy to tone down the overall look, tone down the tinting, the fading and the grain into something that becomes a lot like a good basic classic look — either BW or colour. It's very possible to stay true to the image and simply add a bit of character. But if you just apply Kodak Portra 400 NC++ to all your pictures and call it a day... Chances are you'll be cringing next year.

That's how I see it anyway. The thing with digital is that it's a very cold medium to begin with and even though I love what comes out of my Fuji cameras, I think processing does make a difference. Dodging and burning makes a difference too, as it always has. But it's a fine line.

Personally I find the only images that truly stand the test of time are black and white. Probably because removing colour immediately creates another reality which can't be directly compared to our own. In many ways it's a great equalizer.

Anyone else?

I bought VSCO film for Aperture after having read Patrick's take on it. I still don't use it too much though, and even if I have learnt my basics using a Yashica FX3 and various rolls of tri-x, velvia and sensia, the problem maybe is that I have never used the real Portra , so I don't really know what to expect, what will work etc; I have this feeling that I'm using yet another prebaked filter and this ignorant way of processing does not satisfy me. In fact just yesterday I decided to keep the colors of a recent set of photos straight. Zack Arias in that blog post that was mentioned above says something that expresses my feeling: "Solid color and solid B&W have always been there". So maybe that's the way to go, concentrate on composition and lighting and appropriate focusing technique, and keep the colors straight if the risk is to outdo the processing and come up with something that in a few years will look dated.


The more I learn about digital capture that more I wonder if there is such as thing as straight colors. If you run your RAW files through Aperture, Lightroom and Capture One you will get quite different results, which would be considered straight? What we are seeing when we use a RAW processor is how a particular software company interprets the color recorded in our RAW files. This is not so different from film, except with film it was the film makers interpretation of the color hitting the film. The default output we see from RAW processors tends to be a little more linear, but that is how programmers think. I guess my point is that we are always working with an interpretation of the color that hit the sensor and was recorded in the RAW file.

Now I'm hoping Patrick will jump in with some brilliant words. I'm stuck at the realization that default processing and/or canned filters simply get me somebody else's perception of how the colors should look.



Well... I don't know how brilliant this is going to be but here goes (!)
Robert Boyer is the best guy I know when it comes to describing the properties of film vs digital. He's way beyond my technical expertise on the subject. I'm more in the realm of "feel" — and digital "feels" cold compared to film. Something about the sharpness or the tonal gradations that fall off too quickly, the micro contrast... I think this is a large part of Fuji's appeal: they've created a system that seems to give that certain warmth to the digital files the cameras create. It's not measurable — not by me anyway — but it's that imperceptible quality that modifies the "feel" of those images when compared to other makes.

Again, I have to agree with you David. What's solid colour? There's never been such a thing. Everything has always been an interpretation. When I look at Winogrand images I don't see "real" colours. And what would be "solid BW"? Less contrast? More contrast? Less grain or more grain? Avedon or Capa?
I think this comes back to what I said about dosage earlier. It's easy to go overboard and spread green shadows and grain all over your library, forgetting everything else that makes a great picture.

In the end the image has to work, period.
As for accuracy, I think the idea is to bring back a semblance of character. Film is film — no substitutes can do it justice.


processing. But it doesn't make it right. Or wrong. It's a choice he's made. And while we all have certain stylistic processes that we end up applying to our work, I'm fairly certain he'd be the first one to break those rules if it suited the image. He's also responding to a question about his own work, not teaching a lesson. I doubt he'd submit this as the "right way".

My problem lies with absolutes: VSCO is bad. Real photographers use images SOOC. Hipstamatic is fakery. All of these statements can be true or false depending on the execution and the intent. I love Zack Arias and I think he's a phenomenal photographer. I respect the hell out of that guy. But when I see the work of someone like Alex Majoli for Magnum... I get chills I don't necessarily get when viewing Zack's work. And yet Majoli's photography wouldn't pass the "solid" test with it's crashed blacks and dramatic contrasts. Of course we're talking about very different subject matters being depicted and this will necessarily result in a different emotional response. But even just visually, I usually get shaken by tonal intensity when combined with shape, movement, drama. So is THIS the right way to process? Of course not. There IS no right way. It depends on the subject, on your interpretation.

If we stick to the "straight" theme, Moriyama takes crappy pictures. But his crappy pictures throw me for a spin and drip of intensity. Avedon's 1955 portrait of Marian Anderson bleeds with contrast and tone. It's phenomenal. It lives nowhere near neutral, nowhere near the middle. And it looks like it was shot yesterday.

A timeless image is born out of the reality of a moment and the soul of a photographer. As trends come and go, this may be all that matters.

Slow and steady wins the race. I’ve always been a photographer that stays true to straight color and straight B&W. I’ve seen presets, techniques, and actions come and go. Solid color and solid B&W have always been there. They will always be there. 

VSCO is the hot hipster action pack of today. You can spot it from a mile away. I bought it. I tried it. You know… like you. You wonder. Do I need this? So and so swears by it. I bought it. I tried it. Of the 400 something things I can choose from in their LR presets I like one. Maybe two of them. The rest reek of “fad”. I knew this. I should have just saved my money.

But I get what you are saying. Sometimes you feel like you need to jump in the flow with everyone else. Sometimes it’s boredom. Sometimes it’s just being lazy. I’d love to have a 1,2,3 click and done workflow. I’d love to not give a shit about the output of my work. I’d love to have clients who also don’t give a shit and just want today’s fad because they saw it on some crap wedding details blog.

Yeah. No. That’s not the photographer I want to be. I don’t want my stuff to look dated due to the post production on the photos. I can’t do much about hair styles of those I photograph. :)

Stay true. Stay steady. If you want to chase trends then chase trends. Some like doing that. Go for it. If it’s just not your thing then don’t feel bad about it. Watch my words. VSCO has come and VSCO will go. We’ll all be looking at some NEW AMAZING thing soon enough.

tones are correct. Mid tones are neutral. Shadows aren’t plunged too heavily into black nor shifting in color. I don’t process color to be too cool or too warm.

For B&W I don’t go sepia. Or cyan. Or any of that. I like good contrast between highlights and shadows. I don’t want the highlights to clip to pure white nor do I want to plunge the shadows to completely black. Just a tad of clipping in either of those areas is fine but not much. Just a little. I want the midtones to have clean gradients. I want skin to look right in tonal value. I’ll be doing a video about my B&W conversion soon since I get so many questions regarding that. I’ll be working up several different images from studio to street for that video.

I don’t leave things straight out of camera. Every image gets tweaked a bit for color, contrast, etc. I shoot everything in color and then covert to B&W afterwards in Lightroom or C1 or Photoshop.

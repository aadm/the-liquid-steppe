consider these two photographs:

[quella coi due soli al parco di monza]

[quella a denver con le linee storte e il primo piano leggermente fuori fuoco]

These are the kind of photos that I take entirely to satisfy my own visual appetite; they are not the kind that I then share with the world, because I don't think the world needs yet another picture of trees and sky and buildings.

These are the photos-that-I-like photos, not the photos-that-everybody-like photos.

Photographs that I take my time to inspect and frame. Photos that should be perfect at pixel size, even though I am firmly against pixel-peeping as a judgement factor.

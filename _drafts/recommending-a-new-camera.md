My first 'real' camera was a fully manual, obviously film-based ,Yashica FX-3; now I have a Nikon D7000 which I would probably use even if I was a 'pro', since I appreciate the wonderful mix of lightness and robustness that high-end amateur cameras such as the D7000 offer. Yes, I do appreciate the feeling of operating a D700 (never used a top-end camera such as the Nikon D3 or D4 so I can't comment on that) but they are just too bulky and heavy for my taste; and I equally dislike those light, plasticky cameras such as D3100, D5100, Canon Rebels.

I like the adaptability of DSLRs, the possibility to use 30 years-old lenses, the image quality of course, all the buttons that some people think it's a UI nightmare but in reality allow you to change settings at the speed of light (maybe I'm too traditional but touch screens and navigating through menus just don't work for me).

But I have come to the conclusion that next time a friend asks for some advice on buying a serious camera I will not recommend a DSLR. They are just a big, giant, incredible pain in the ass.

I wrote some weeks ago about my D7000, and how I realized that most of my lenses needed some AF fine tuning because otherwise at large apertures I could never get those crazily sharp images that is the whole point of using a serious camera. For some reasons (that I'm a friggin' nerd, probably), I went back to this, and ran some other tests using a tripod, a focus lens chart, and I spent hours calibrating four lenses (35mm f/1.8G, 85mm f/1.8G, 50mm f/1.8D, 50mm f/1.4). Yes, I did learn a few things: I have seen for real and realized what really is 'soft' (e.g., using the 50mm f/1.4 at full aperture), how much the movement of the mirror affects the camera even when using a tripod (so the mirror lock-up function is actually useful), how incredibly sharp are these lenses when stopped down a little bit (so from now on I will have a clear idea about the optimal range of apertures that I have to use if I want maximum detail).

But even if I knew that in principle there are so many things to keep under control, I have always had the idea that only pixel-peepers and hardcore techno-geeks would only see these problems and normal people could go on using their DSLRs with no problems. The truth is that issues with AF and with the random pairing camera-lens have a noticeable effect on the end result, even if viewed with a non-hypercritical eye.

A few years ago I would have still recommended a DSLR because their image quality was unsurpassed at the time, but now my advice would be only one: forget DSLRs, get a mirrorless camera! Something like the Olympus OM-D if you need the reassurance of a familiar face; or a Sony NEX if you want sleek, modern lines; or a Fuji X-series if you want retro-cool chic and maximum image quality. These cameras may have slower autofocus systems but they are accurate and do not need fine tuning; there's abundance of lenses especially for a micro 4/3 camera like the OM-D; their image quality is on par with crop sensor DSLRs (actually there's people saying that the Fuji X-Pro delivers images which top the output of a full frame Canon 5D!).

I still like my DSLR, I have a good selection of lenses that I'm fond of, but let me tell ya -- a little Fuji XE-1 with maybe a 35mm f/1.4 and the 60mm macro does have a certain allure, even more now that I have spent two entire days checking and re-checking the stupid AF of my Nikon.

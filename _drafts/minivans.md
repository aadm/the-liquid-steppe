I could have never foreseen this. That is, finding myself contemplating minivans and discussing their merits the engines, their cornering ability. 

My first car was a Peugeot 106 Rallye; I was actually lusting after the real myth, the 205 Rallye, but back in 1990 the 106 was the new kid on the block and I went for it, also because the 205 was not in production anymore and I could not find a reliable second hand car. 


So I pictured myself graduating to more sporty and faster vehicles but then reality set in; after the Mini I bought a second-hand boring-grey, turbo diesel (!) Golf. It was a reasoned decision because I was also at that time deeply into that other very expensive but more satisfying form of motoring, i.e. motorbikes. More satisfying because the same amount of money spent on motorbikes gives you much more in terms of power and racing abilities; but this is a different story and involves my longstanding affair with Ducati and the Ducati Speedweek races. 

Anyway the golf was meant to be a temporary thing, and while trying to be more realistic (no Porsches or Lotuses at the horizon) I set my hopes on the GTI version which someday might take me and the bikes (that i began to stuff in the Golf's capacious boot) around with some more vivacity than the bog-diesel engined. 

And then, unexpectedly, these large, working-class VW Transporters began exercising a strong attraction. Maybe together with the realisation that the only vehicle that I was able to maintain and race with the little budget I had was a bicycle, these minivans began to interest me because I could fit everything easily inside, because so many people I could see living off these things, because I had a wonderful time in 2009 traveling across California with a rented Westfalia, maybe because Giulia too was into camping and campervans, who knows. 

So in 2011 as a wedding present Giulia and I bought a brand new VW California and well never look back at this decision. 

And now, every time I go to those places that act like a magnet for all active people, I see only VW Transporters and Caravelle and California. It really looks the best van ever and I dig the simple but attractive design. 

These are just some of the various models I have met and photographed during various weekends in Finale Logire.

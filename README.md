# the-liquid-steppe

This repo stores the content of my old (Jekyll) blog. Only the source code though. I tried so hard to make it actually work and be live at aadm.github.io/the-liquid-steppe but I couldn't. That really pissed me off as it was so easy with Pelican.

Well that's another reason to be happy with Pelican.

I recommend to move on and visit my main website: <http://aadm.github.io>

A [great article on Slate.com](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2011/02/the_stutterer.html): taking inspiration from "King's speech", a stutterer writes about stuttering.

Some great insights, worth reading if you are vaguely interested in the subject (or if you have a friend who stammers and want to know what on earth does he think when he's stuck on a word).

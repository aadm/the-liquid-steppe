Had a great day of riding last Saturday. Woke up at 6:30am, took the 7:39 train to Sestri Levante. Three hours or so, and then here I am in Sestri; cool breeze, warm sunshine, I started following the Superenduro signs. Here's a few pics that sum up the day.

And PS1, 2 and 3 were gone in a second; too much fun to stop.

Some pics of PS4: they're all for you, Phil.

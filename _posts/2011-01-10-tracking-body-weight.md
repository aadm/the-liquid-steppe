I discovered [this Withings wi-fi body scale](http://www.withings.com/en/bodyscale/features) after reading [this tweet by Neven Mrgan](https://twitter.com/mrgan/status/17993820817854464):

It sounds like a great tool to track your body weight: compare it to [what I've done last year](http://aadm.github.com/2010-09-24-allenamenti-2010.html).

However, I doubt I'll ever buy it. Too much technology around you really
damages your health much more than a cappuccino and cornetto.

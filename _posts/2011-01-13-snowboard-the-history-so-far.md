I began snowboarding on the 13th of March. So far, I've spent a total of eight
days on the board (spread on 3 weekends). In these eight days I've taken 8
hours of private lessons with two very skilled (and patient) instructors of
the Val di Fassa Ski and Snowboarding school.

My last weekend, however, was the turning point, as I decided to buy the full
kit and discovered how easy snowboarding is if you have the right tool. And
the right tool is a board with this innovative shape called 'rocker' (as
opposed to the traditional 'camber' shape). My friend Paolo told me about
these "new geometries" which were being developed in North America where he
was living last year. He told me to check [Libtech's website](http://www.lib-tech.com/snow/tech/banana-technology/) to see what was this 'banana' shape.
What I ended up buying is a [Burton TWC Standard](http://www.burton.com/mens-boards-twc-standard-snowboard/231613,default,pd.html), which is like an entry
level board: friendly banana (or 'rocker') shape, very flexible, right size
for my height and weight (172cm+68kg=154cm board).

I think I was hooked to snowboarding as soon as I realized how easy is to turn
with these new board. I'm looking forward to use it again.

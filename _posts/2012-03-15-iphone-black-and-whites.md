I'm a believer now: with an iPhone (4S) and a nice cool application such as Snapseed, you can really get good shots. I hesitate to call them 'artistic' even if other people may do so. That's not art to replicate the look of a heavily pushed Kodak Tri-X, but they are cool nonetheless.

I should write something more about Snapseed, how this approach to photo editing is perfect for an iPhone.  I was one of those nerds who like to endlessly play with Curves, so my philosophy has always been that you need to work hard to improve a shot, and the idea of applying an automatic adjuster-thingy was never considered. 

Yet here I am, with some black and white / fake Tri-X shots of Giulia.

While these are two shots of an upcoming project, tentatively called "Streelife Milano" (that's a joke, I mean who wants to see another collection of street photography? And I don't even have a Leica!).

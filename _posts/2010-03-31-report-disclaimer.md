"This report relates the results of an advanced, quantitative seismic
characterization of the Alpha field, through simultaneous elastic inversion,
rock physics modelling and stochastic classification. In the absence of any
reliable geophysical data, the opinions and interpretations presented in this
report were invented. However, due to the uncertainty inherent in the
estimation of all sub-surface parameters, they might as well turn out to be
correct, almost correct, slightly wrong or totally fucked up. We cannot and do
not guarantee the accuracy of any interpretation carried out by our officers,
agents or employees. We shall not, _except in case of success_, be responsible
for any loss, cost or damage incurred."

From a review of a soft-science book appeared recently [on the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/science/16scibks.html):

> Though the authors occasionally lapse into jargon (their barnacles cling to “substrate” until the animals die and their six-plate shells “become disarticulated”)

_Substrate_ and _disarticulated_ jargon? Maybe I've been away too long, but it
seems to me that substrate and disarticulated are normal words that even a
non-scientist can understand (or at least, grasp their meaning).

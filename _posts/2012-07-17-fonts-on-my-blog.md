Last time [I wrote something about this blog](2012-07-12-moving-to-github.html), how I moved everything to Jekyll and modified the original themes. 

Then Ian [tweeted about that issue that I had with the fonts](https://twitter.com/largeuk/status/223700925959770112), that the blog looked differently when viewed on a PC or a Mac. And he also added that embedding fonts was easy.

So I looked around and in fact it was easy; more importantly, there's plenty of open source fonts [made available by Google](http://www.google.com/webfonts/). What was *not* easy was to decide which combination of fonts to use.

I have found these places particularly helpful in teaching me a crash course on typography:

* <http://www.personal.psu.edu/jxm22/fonts>
* <http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type>
* <http://sachagreif.com/google-webfonts-that-dont-suck>

At the end I had two options: [Quicksand](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Quicksand) (headings) and [Quattrocento Sans](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Quattrocento+Sans) (body), or [Averia Sans Libre](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Averia+Sans+Libre) + Quattrocento Sans.

So no doubts on the body font -- even though all these knowledgeable people that have written reasonable and reasoned pieces on these Google fonts have had nothing to say on Quattrocento Sans so there *must* be something not right. But I can't see it.

My gut feeling is that Quattrocento Sans (and its serif counterpart, Quattrocento) are beatifully designed fonts and they make for an excellent reading experience; their creator, [Pablo Impallari](http://www.impallari.com/), is an argentinian who surely know a lot of shit -- total respect for this guy.

For the headings, as of today, Averia Sans Libre won. 

##evolution of the style

I started with a very simple combination of Helvetica Neue and Optima:

Which looked terrible on a PC though as I was using fonts that were specific to Macs:

Then I tried Quicksand which I liked for the headings, together with a old-fashion Cardo:

Finally I settled on Averia Sans Libre and Quattrocento Sans, plus Cousine as a fixed-width font for `code paragraphs`:

And now the site looks (almost) the same also on PC running Windows:

##update August 2012

I have changed fonts once again. Now the headers are News Cycle, and the body fonts are still Quattrocento Sans (proportional) and Cousine (fixed width).

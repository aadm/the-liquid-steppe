"I felt a sense of relief at his unshaven face and scruffy clothes. I have rarely seen a more disreputable bunch."

-- Ed Hillary (the Everest guy) about [Eric Shipton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Shipton) (another great mountaineer and explorer), as reported in the fantastic 2-part history of Everest written by Ed Webster (Alpinist issues [26](http://www.alpinist.com/doc/ALP26)-[27](http://www.alpinist.com/doc/ALP27)).

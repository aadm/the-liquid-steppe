It just happened that all the past "weekly snaps" have featured photos linked by some sort of thread or connection. But my original idea was to collect random shots [as I wrote at the beginning](./2012-07-10-weekly-snaps-1.html).

So today I was resolved in finding a few shots that I liked, with nothing to link them; I went from folder to folder in my library, and selected these shots.

However, I now realize that even all of these photographs are joined by something; it's a bit obscure, and unless you are a bit of a naturalist, you might not find it though (especially for that brown rocky patch)[^nota].

[^nota]: It's *water* of course. That brown and green photo from Spain above? An ancient river bed, obviously.

I love tech bloggers such as [Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/),
[Brooks](http://brooksreview.net/), [Arment](http:/marco.org/). Even if there
really is nothing in common between me and those guys except for a generic
interest in technology and nerdism, I still love their passion, the public
interactions on twitter and instagram (true, sometimes their shots are not
really worth much praise, but praised they are), and in some cases (e.g.,
Gruber) their writing craft.

But today I was reading a blog post by [one of these guys](http://forkbombr.net/revolution-then-evolution/) and asked incredously
myself: "how does somebody that has a passion for writing, and who's a native
english speaker, make these errors ?".

And this is the shit I've read:

> My first Mac was the 1GHz Titanium PowerBook G4 [â€¦] _It's_ 15-inch widescreen display was stunning, and _it's_ razor-thin case boggled the mind.

Hell, do I even need to emphasize the error above ?

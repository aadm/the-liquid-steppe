"Those of us who were bewitched by his eloquence on the campaign trail chose
to ignore some disquieting aspects of his biography: that he had accomplished
very little before he ran for president, having never run a business or a
state; that he had a singularly unremarkable career as a law professor,
publishing nothing in 12 years at the University of Chicago other than an
autobiography; and that, before joining the United States Senate, he had voted
“present” (instead of “yea” or “nay”) 130 times, sometimes dodging difficult
issues."

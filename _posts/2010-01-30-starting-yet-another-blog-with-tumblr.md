Ok, so the story goes like this: I already have a (rarely) updated blog at
[aadm.wordpress.com](http://aadm.wordpress.com), sometimes I post shorties to
[twitter](http://twitter.com/aadmtwi), and all of this seems too much to
handle, so again: why the hell should I start using
[tumblr](http://aadm.tumblr.com/) ?

*Edit January 2012: as it turns out, I got fed up with Tumblr and moved all of this to [calepin](whttp://calepin.co).*

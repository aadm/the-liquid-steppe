So true:

> Reading fiction is important. It is a vital means of imagining a life other than our own, which in turn makes us more empathetic beings. Following complex story lines stretches our brains beyond the 140 characters of sound-bite thinking, and staying within the world of a novel gives us the ability to be quiet and alone, two skills that are disappearing faster than the polar icecaps.

Ann Patchett, from [yesterday's New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/opinion/and-the-winner-of-the-pulitzer-isnt.html).

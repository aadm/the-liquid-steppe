A brief interlude to note down a couple of things.

## "on taking pictures" and my name

I follow only one podcast, and that's [On Taking Pictures](http://5by5.tv/otp). As the name says, it's about photography, and in one recent Q&A episode they kindly answered a question I have made; what's cool however is their comment on my name which I'd like to remember for the future -- skip to the 1h18'28" mark:

# flickr blog and baobabs

Flickr has published a [collection of baobab's photographs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/galleries/72157645103036432/) and have included [one of my photos](http://flic.kr/p/dWWjYD) from my Madagascar honeymoon trip[^nota-madagascar]. 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/8497971885/" title="_1050194 by aadm, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8243/8497971885_7ee2ba2c16_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="_1050194"></a>

That's kinda interesting, especially because I've seen with my own eyes how much "likes" (actually, stars in flickr's lingo) or views (almost two thousand as of today! usually my photos get 30-40 views tops) I have received for this photo in the space of a few hours. Definitely a lesson to be learnt -- if you're chasing the ephemeral glory of internet fame and many likes or stars, better use some marketing skills, post your crap on hundreds of flickr galleries for example, and more generally advertise your work as much as you can. Don't bother spending your time actually working on your skills, improving your technique or training your eye; on the internet the actual quality of the work comes a distant second. 

Anyway, the picture above is ok but really nothing special, probably a bit too conventional -- I'd have preferred flickr to choose one of these two:

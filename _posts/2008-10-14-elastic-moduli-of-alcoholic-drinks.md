I'm in charge of a very important research project here at Acme Ltd., a major player in the oil business. With the latest state-of-the-art equipment I study the effects of hydrocarbons on seismic data; one way to do that is to model a porous medium filled with fluid which is like a rock filled with oil or shit.  
  
There is a set of equations studied by two guys (Batzle and Wang) that are widely used in the industry to compute the elastic properties of a reservoir fluid starting from environmental parameters such as pressure and temperature.  
  
So far, so conventional.  
  
So what I want to do now is to model the effect that alcoholic drinks have on the seismic response of a reservoir. And I need your help. So if you happen to know bulk moduli and density of the following drinks, well known in Italy as "digestivi", please send them over:  
  
  * Cynar
  * Aperol
  * Limoncello
  * Padre Peppe
  
The scientific community will be forever grateful.

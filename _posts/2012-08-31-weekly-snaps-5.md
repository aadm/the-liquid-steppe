I haven't been able to publish these 'weekly snaps' for the past three weeks, but here I am with number 5; this time I'll start off with a couple of clich√© photos.

_[Boschi di Carrega](http://parchi.parma.it/page.asp?IDCategoria=272), Parma. Nikon D7000, 35mm f/1.8G; f/4 and 1/800s. Shooting something new in the woods is incredibly frustrating, unless you are in some North American National Park, with oblique sun rays lighting up a thousand years old tree. But I wasn't in Yosemite or Sequoia National Park, it was midday, and yet I wanted to capture something fresh. The result is not entirely satisfying mostly because of the slightly nervous bokeh of the Nikon 35 1.8G. Some parts of the leaves are also out of focus._

_Same place, same idea, same gear, second attempt to capture something of these woods. Bleached out in post-production._

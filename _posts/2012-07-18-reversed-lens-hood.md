Emphasis is mine:

> Shoot from the hip and sort it out later in Photoshop; this is a slippery slope plunging inevitably towards the depths of despair and devastating loss of self-esteem that comes with shooting on program mode with a high ISO, no tripod and a **reversed lens hood**. The latter is the photographic equivalent of wearing socks with sandals; clearly a fate worse than death.

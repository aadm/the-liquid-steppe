I've (finally) subscribed to flickr, so now I'm a 'pro' user. Following the same ligthroom workflow that I'm describing in this blog, I have uploaded a few pictures taken in the last few months.  
  
This shot is from the recent Ducati Speedweek, a racing event which was held in Hungary at the end of July.  

I joined a group of friends from the Multistrada forum and raced in the class B (two-cylinder engines, 2 valves per cylinder; in other words all the bikes with the usual air-cooled desmodue engine such as Supersport 900 and 1000, Monster 1000, Monster S2R, plus anything fitted with this engine, i.e. the brand new Bimota Delirio).  
  
More photos, including some very nice shots taken by Gardello during the race, can be found in this flickr set, [Ducati Speedweek 2006](http://flickr.com/photos/aadm/sets/72157594228396265/).

A 1945 video on Raleigh bicycles, worth watching for historical reasons but also for something that the speaker says towards the end of the movie (around the 16'45" mark):


> [...] There are bicycles for all purposes, suitable for men, women boys and girls. A bycicle is a comfortable and cheap way of getting about, a great boon to men, ideal for shopping, easy to park [...] A faithful friend ever ready to take tired workers back home and after work to bring relaxation, health and happiness.

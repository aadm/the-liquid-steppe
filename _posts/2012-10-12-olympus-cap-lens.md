It might be quirky and it might be cool but I would argue this is something which should not appeal to anybody apart from facebook photographers.

The reasons are two:

1. judging from the shots which you can see [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/an_aussie_in_guernsey/sets/72157631683828773/with/8071749336/) the quality is abysmal. But you have to look at 100%, and while I'm against pixel peeping, when it comes to a technical choice, there is no other way to judge objectively the quality of a lens. This is why I think it may only appeal to facebook photographer, because reduced to web size all photos are sharp and correctly focused (there is a law waiting to be expressed: the lower the resolution of your final output, the less you can spend on equipment, or something like that).
2. the price is ridiculous ($110). I would then happily recommend buying a [Pinwide](http://www.flickr.com/photos/an_aussie_in_guernsey/sets/72157631683828773/with/8071749336/) for $40 which makes a completely different kind of photo (real quirky here!, not crappy-quirky) or the wonderful Lumix 14mm f/2.5 which can be found used for $100 and is *tiny* (I recently bought this lens for in my latest trip to the US to replace the Olympus 17mm f/2.8 which was starting to get on my nerves with its plasticky silver color).

This week's post has been delayed by some [very expected news](http://aadm.github.com/2012-08-04-valentina.html).

I'll start off with two variations of a similar photo I published in [Weekly snaps #3](http://aadm.github.com/2012-07-27-weekly-snaps-3.html); the first is a classical black and white, the second a slightly toned black and white.

Then I have three photos which were the first ones shot with the Nikon D7000; they were very poor in terms of exposure accuracy but then I was very surprised at the amount of stuff I could recover in post processing; a truly wonderful sensor inside the D7000.

Finally a snowy landscape which may remind you that "winter is coming".

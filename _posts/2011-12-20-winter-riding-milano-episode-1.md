So I've been busy shooting some videos with a friend and what I discovered is this: it's a lot of work to ride hunting for location and constantly stop to shoot a five seconds clip !

Anyway, the idea was to show in 3 episodes the kind of riding you can do around Milano; it's not Liguria, it's not mediterranean rocky trails, but it's close and it's fun.

There's lots to improve, like for example the shaky camera; I've used for 90% of the shots a monopod which is light and easy to setup, but doesn't give you steady shots -- and this has some impact on the final perceived quality of the video.

I also need to watch more carefully if the shots are in focus or not, to keep a constant exposure and so on. The Nikon D7000 doesn't help here because it's a real pain in the ass to adjust all the settings before entering Liveview.

For the geeks out there here's some info on the gear: Nikon D7000 with a Nikkor 35mm f1.8, a 50mm f1.8 and a Tokina 12-24mm; Manfrotto monopod and for a couple of shots I've used a Gorilla tripod for SLRs. Oh and my Transition Covert to ride along.
 
Anyway enjoy this first episode, and watch out this space for the next one entirely filmed on Monte Canto.

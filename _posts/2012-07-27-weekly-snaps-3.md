This week, moody skies.

All shots taken with a Nikon D7000 during last weekend's walks in and around town with Giulia. I wanted to add "all shots were minimally processed except for *that one*" but the reality[^1] is that I used also some dodge and burn, at least one curve adjustment and several other little tweaks. As [somebody once said](http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog/2012/7/19/seeing-mono.html), no photo is truly OOC (straight out of the camera).

And about *that one*, well that one was the easiest one as I just applied [Laroque's snap preset](http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog/2011/7/14/dissecting-the-look-post-processing-in-aperture-3.html) for that one. 

First comes the rain:

Then the skies:

And finally -- as the Blur used to say -- "[you should cut down on your porklife mate, get some exercise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIEsmGzo2UE)":

[^1]: I'm enjoying the processing capabilities of Aperture but even more a cheap little Bamboo table that is essential for some brush action. I bought mine some time ago after my friend Daniele told me that it was a must for photo editing. Turns out, he was right.

Using everytrail for iphone: the app shows for this particular trip 33km in 1
hour and 19 minutes with a resulting average speed of 25km/h.

The [same trip displayed on
everytrail.com](http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=734747) is 1
hour and 46 minutes long, however, which makes for an average speed of 18.6
km/h.

I have paused the tracking after having arrived at destination, then resumed
for the return trip. I think that everytrail.com does not understand the
timecodes in the gpx file.

This is easily proven by loading the gpx into another application. I have done
so (using rubiTrack), and in fact it shows the same duration as my iPhone: 1
hour and 19 minutes.

[iPad and crufty interfaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20051107101903/http://

Why the iPad is a potentially groundbreaking platform, despite the accusations
of being 'only a large iPhone'.

Just read this old piece written in 2003 by a (very smart) tech blogger; it's
about user interface defects as heritage of early computer hardware
limitations, such as the presence of _save_ and _quit_ commands.

Step back to 2010, and guess what is the only computing platform that does not
have any _save_ and _quit_ commands ? Correct, it's the iPad.

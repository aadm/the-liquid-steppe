I've been stuck at home due to a <del>minor</del> major incident in the past 4 weeks, so I had the chance to enjoy a couple of TV series: Seinfeld (1st and 2nd season) and Huff.  
  
*Seinfeld* is a wickedly funny show "about nothing" as the americans say; never heard of it here in Italy, and I suppose that it's a kind of show that would not translate as well to the italian taste as Friends. So there's Jerry Seinfeld (a real first class stand-up comedian), his ex-grilfriend and two other buddies, New York and a local cafe', nice intermezzos where Seinfeld plays himself doing the stand-up comedy thing, and lots of brilliant jokes and comedy setups that you really love to watch'em again and again.  
Mind you, it's really addictive stuff: once you begin watching it you will not stop. Believe me.  
  
*Huff* is a serious one. I like it because it's really got an adult, un-adulterated content. Harsh at times and sometimes dark as the Sopranos. A brilliant cast with that favourite of mine, Hank Azaria (some of you might remember him in Friends, playing Phoebe's geek scientist fiancee'). Sometimes a little bit too sugary. Thanks god there's Russell Tupper, a cocaine-fueled sharp-mouthed lawyer that I've just elected my personal hero of the month.

Inspired by Pindelski's blog[^1] here's my first collection of snaps, something that I'll try to honour as a weekly appointment.

There will not be a common theme or anything like that, and I cannot promise to post *new* snaps every week (most of the times I have a feeling that it will be stuff from my archive).

What you will find in here is photos that I have taken and that I want to hold on to for whatever reason I may have. And the fact of publishing them online is an act that makes them prominent, and gives them the recognition which I feel they deserve in that particular moment when I sit down and write.

So let's start with *weekly snaps #1*.

*** 

These first three shots were taken last Sunday when I had probably the last hike in the mountains just me and me wife. Very soon there will be a third little one joining us. By the way, our little one is still un-named so we welcome any suggestion on how to call her.

These other shots were taken during a short holiday at Elba, a wonderful island just off the coast of Tuscany. Go there only in June or September to avoid all the (other) tourists. It's also a great place for biking.

[^1]: [Thomas Pindelski](http://pindelski.org/Photography) is not the only photographer out there who posts his photos with a bit of context, as opposed to dumping shots on flickr, but he's the first that comes to my mind; I don't know why but I find myself strangely hooked by his passion for ancient primes and San Francisco street shots, his sarcastic english voice (so different from the american breed of tech bloggers who cannot spell the pronoun 'its' without the apostrophe) and his ancient sage / Ben Kenobi approach to life.

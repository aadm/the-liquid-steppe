I honestly don't know what the fuck is with these "beatiful" apps for iOS.

Here's [another one](http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist/) that's getting
raving reviews: it's a simple task management app that focuses on cloud
syncing, changing background pictures, being free etc.

But what's the point in having all these things that makes an app "beatiful"
if it's so slow in loading a checklist with 20 (twenty ! not a thousand !)
items ?

I must say I really wanted to like this app (_nice developers from Germany:
check!, free as in free beer: check! cross-platform compatibility: check!_)
but the fact that such a simple task is being handled like it's DNA
sequencing, that I can't stand.

And so I'm back to the quick & naked checklists of
[Simplenote](http://simplenoteapp.com/).

Oh and the screenshots above ? I'll leave to your imagination to understand
which is which. One is "beatiful", the other is just quick.

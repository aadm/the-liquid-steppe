From ["Secrets of a Mind-Gamer"](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/20/magazine/mind-secrets.html), a fascinating article on a normal guy who becomes a memory champion:
 
> In his 1869 book _Hereditary Genius_ Sir Francis Galton argued that a person
could improve at mental and physical activities until he hit a wall, which “he
cannot by any education or exertion overpass.” In other words, the best we can
do is simply the best we can do. But Ericsson and his colleagues have found
over and over again that with the right kind of effort, that’s rarely the
case. They believe that Galton’s wall often has much less to do with our
innate limits than with what we consider an acceptable level of performance.  They’ve found that top achievers typically follow the same general pattern.
They develop strategies for keeping out of the autonomous stage by doing three
things: focusing on their technique, staying goal-oriented and getting
immediate feedback on their performance […] To improve, we have to be
constantly pushing ourselves beyond where we think our limits lie and then pay
attention to how and why we fail.

This piece which appeared on the New York Times a few weeks ago got me hooked: ["They had it made"](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/opinion/12brooks.html), by David Brooks. This is just one click away from the full essay published on the online June issue of The Atlantic, ["What makes us happy"](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200906/happiness), by Joshua W. Shenk.  
  
Go back in time and there's another article on the Grant Study which appeared in the 1990: ["Men at 65: New Findings On Well-Being"](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/16/science/men-at-65-new-findings-on-well-being.html?fta=y).  
  
Further back and you discover this book by George Vaillant, ["Adaptation to Life"](http://books.google.it/books?id=SQdVNojI0O0C), which tells us the story of the Grant Study men when they were 47.  
  
There is also two interviews to members of the Grant Study, [Donald Cole](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200905u/donald-cole) and [Ben Bradlee](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200905u/ben-bradlee).  
  
A final curiosity: there is no Wikipedia entry on the Grant study.

I have recently subscribed to [Alpinist](http://www.alpinist.com/), a truly wonderful magazine; there was this very funny cartoon here that I just _had_ to share with my climbing friends. So I took my D70s, grabbed a picture and here it is: version 10.0 Climbing Partner.  
  
By the way, I wonder why there is no such thing here in Italy as Alpinist or [Dirt Rag](http://www.dirtragmag.com/print/index.php) ?

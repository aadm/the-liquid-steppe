"I was out running errands today, walking through the city. I remembered, a
mile away from home, that a screw had fallen out of my wife’s favorite
eyeglasses over the weekend, and that she was waiting for me to fix them.
Walking down a city street, I said, “Remind me to fix Amy’s glasses when I get
home.” Half an hour later, within a few doors of our house, the reminder went
off."

Today a very good thing happened to me, but it was followed by a very bad thing. Anyway I won't talk about good or bad things here because they're personal.  
  
For now all I want is to point the casual reader to [a blog](http://www.silvioinamericadelsud.blogspot.com/) (travelogue, climbing diary, don't know how's gonna be shaped) which was just started by a good friend of mine, somebody that sooner or later will appear as special guest star in a (true) tale that I will post here.  
  
The friend is Silvio, and on the 19th of September he's left a very good position in London (let's not forget his beatiful flat) to start a 10-month climbing trip that will take him (if all goes well, and I certainly hope this will be the case) to summit 35 peaks in Southern America.  
  
I'll track his progress with the help of this [blog](http://www.silvioinamericadelsud.blogspot.com/) and this [flickr page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/silviosparano73/sets).  
  
Good luck Silvio, I shall see you in 10 months; I wonder what your eyes will look like at your return.

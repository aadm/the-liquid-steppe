There is a certain kind of photograph that creates a particular atmosphere, and even though it may not be related to actual weather events, sometimes it does.

Here there are a few of these "atmospheric photographs"; they were all taken within walking distance from where I live.

<!-- And more often than not, I find myself transported in a certain heightened state of mind. I am not sure if others may relate to that but here there are some photographs that I have taken in this past year which are very evocative to me.

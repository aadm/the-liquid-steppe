The creators of Lost, in an interview given in 2005 (right after the
conclusion of season 1):

> The survivors will not learn they are part of some dastardly experiment, or discover they are in purgatory, or wake up from a bad dream.

([The Laws of the Jungle](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/arts/television/18manl.html) by Lorne Manly, 18 September 2005).

So how did it end season 6, exactly ?

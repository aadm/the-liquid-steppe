I swear it was unintentional. Second post straight after [this one where I blurbed about my next camera](http://aadm.github.com/2010-08-19-my-next-camera.html), and here it is, the GF-1 in my hands.

So how did it happen: I spent last weekend in Livigno for some mountain biking. On Sunday afternoon, half an hour before end of business, I went into a shop and asked for the Panasonic GF-1. They had only the body, as they sold separately the 20mm lens which was part of the kit. So I asked, maybe you have a spare lens like the 17mm from some Olympus body?

And yes they did. This is how I ended up with a rather unusual bundle.

I know, the Olympus 17mm f/2.8 is not the same thing as the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7. But you see, in Livigno they have no IVA (equivalent of UK's VAT).

And they made a very good price.

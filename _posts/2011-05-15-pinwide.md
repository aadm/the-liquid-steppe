First experiments with the Pinwide by
[Wanderlust](http://wanderlustcameras.com/products/pinwide.html). I used it
for a few shots last weekend, tried to use it as a normal lens during a bike
ride from Milano to Lecco along the river Adda. I soon realized that pinhole
photography needs far more care and attention to get satisfying results (for
other unsatisfying results see also [this flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/sets/72157626603503419/)).

Anyway the Pinwide makes the GF-1 even smaller and since it's just piece of plastic only
a little bigger than a lens cap it's very easy to take it everywhere -- the
only problem is that you need some sort of tripod to get stable shots even in
full daylight.

_What kind of paper do you use, what kind of pen and ink?_

CRUMB

_Well, I use the old Strathmore vellum surface paper, which is the best paper
you can get in the Western world for ink line drawing. It has a good, hard
surface. I have it mailed from the New York Central Art Supply in New York.
For a while I was using this old Strathmore paper from fifty years ago that
some guy sent me, it had bad comic art on one side, hacked-out comic work from
1959, 1960, but the paper is superior to anything you can get now. It just
holds the ink better. I ran out of that and now I use this new stuff thatâ€™s
not quite as good._

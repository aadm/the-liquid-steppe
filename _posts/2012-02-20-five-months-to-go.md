Guido gave me the idea with a link to [this video by the Fleet Foxes](http://vimeo.com/21577557). Giulia and I spent a weekend in the mountains and I quickly put together this little edit to show what we've been doing; walking in the snow, skiing and snowboarding, eating, breathing in fresh air. 

And our daughter will arrive in five months.

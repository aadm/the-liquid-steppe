Yesterday I was browsing [Merlin Mann's 43folders](http://www.43folders.com/) , and I've stumbled upon [his definition of geek](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done/):  


> I think Getting Things Done appeals to geeks for a lot of reasons. Overgeneralizing for effect:  

> * geeks are often disorganized or have a twisted skein of attention-deficit issues  
* geeks love assessing, classifying, and defining the objects in their world
* geeks crave actionable items and roll their eyes at “mission statements” and lofty management patois
* geeks like things that work with technology-agnostic and lofi tools
* geeks like frameworks but tend to ignore rules  
* geeks are unusually open to change (if it can be demonstrated to work better than what they’re currently using)  
* geeks like fixing things on their own terms  
* geeks have too many projects and lots and lots of stuff  
  
  
Well, GTD does not appeal to me (even though I have already written [a short note about it](http://aadm.github.com/2005-08-24-italian-gtd.html)), but all of the above points.... man, that's me !  

I'm so glad not be alone in this world. Now, where can I have [a t-shirt like this](http://xkcd.com/c23.html)?

The real thing looks wonderful and I bet works great too: Luma Loops. Another company that produces
something similar (I believe they were the first, way before Luma Loops came to life) is [Blackrapid](http://www.blackrapid.com).

I see their point: I have never fitted conventional neck straps on my cameras
-- they make cameras too bulky and cumbersome.

But on my GF1 I wanted something to hold on to. So there's a few people around
that have shown their DIY versions of Lumaloops:

I wanted something similar, but I didn't have any nylon to sew the straps. So
I made two straps using recycled buckles and neck straps from my old cameras.

**Model 1**: the safe model (there's no buckles). Recommended for intense outdoor activity.

**Model 2**: the practical model (you get buckles). Ability to remove the longest part of the strap for arsing around in town and other boring places.

_Doesn't work: if you pull, it gets undone._

_A split ring attachment to the camera which I don't like, because it's metal on metal._

_Update: Luma Labs fell prey to some patent issues since I wrote this post, so they have discontinued the original Luma Loop. They do have a plan to launch another strap, the Cinch. Check out their website [luma-labs.com](http://www.luma-labs.com/) and also this [open letter published on their blog](http://luma-labs.com/blogs/news/4540122-an-open-letter-to-our-customers-past-and-future)._

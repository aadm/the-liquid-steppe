It's been [more than a year since I moved to a Jekyll blog](2012-07-12-moving-to-github.html) hosted on github. I think I have never been so productive in this period of time, despite having a much busier life both at work and off-work (Valentina is here and she's here to stay! We have now trespassed the 15 months mark, if she was a car I'd say we have a looser engine now -- and it shows from the way she runs and skettles; she is just _unstoppable_).

I have spent however far too much time adjusting the way this site looks, and I am never satisfied. I have a designer's eye but a designer's skill definitely not.

I have googled the net and finally I have landed on something, a "responsive"  (whatever that means in nerdish) theme, that even with my limited web skills, was actually easy to install on my jekyll blog.


The theme is called [So Simple](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/) and I like it because is clean and refined. I like it so much that I haven't changed anything -- and I would like to keep it that way. I mean, let's focus on the content!

So there you go. This is the new look.

And here's what this site looked before:

Last Thursday I arrived in the States, and I went through the usual US border
immigration procedure. The agent, after careful examination of my passport
with lots of Egyptian visa stamps, says:

  * _Been to Egypt a lot, ah ?_

  * _Yes, a few times but it's been more than a year since my last time._

  * _So you haven't been there after the TERRORIST TAKEOVER ?_

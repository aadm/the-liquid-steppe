In [this previous post](2010-12-21-dailybooth.html) I linked to [an article that upset me](http://www.gq.com/news-politics/big-issues/201012/viral-me-silicon-valley-social-networking-devin-friedman).

It tells a story about these incredibly smart kids that waste their time and
energy (and considerable amounts of brain, apparently) to build yet another
'social' things; Internet services that basically allow the user to shut their
minds, do fuck-all (apart from taking a picture maybe), and in return be
"famous" (in the Facebook sense).

Is this really the way the Internet is developing? Towards a weapon of brain
annihilation?

For another view on why social network may turn out to be the silliest of all
Internet evolutionary branches, see also [Tim Berners-Lee's article on Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=long-live-the-web).

I have sketched a series of yoga poses that I follow as a daily exercise.

I thought they might be of interest to someone else as well, so I've put them on this [Flickr set](//www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/sets/72157624779874539/detail/).

Feel free to grab them, print them out but remember that they have been hand-draw[^nota-handdrawn] on a few evenings between August and September 2010, so be nice to them and send me an email if you need them for other purposes apart from your personal use.  
  
[^nota-handdrawn]: Hand-drawn on a mac, using a Wacom Bamboo Pen tablet. I forgot how much fun I had drawing doodles; I guess the last time I did something like this was in high school.

[As promised before](http://aadm.github.com/2011-12-20-winter-riding-milano-episode-1.html), here's episode 2 of the miniseries "Winter Riding Milano".

It was shot with Masatomo on Monte Canto, another beatiful riding spot close to Milan with lots of natural trails. What is shown here is a classic one: starting from Sotto il Monte we cycled up to the top and then down on the Kompressor trail.

Again it was such great fun (and again we were incredibly lucky with the weather, doesn't really look like it's winter!) that at the end [we cycled back up and then came down again](http://connect.garmin.com/activity/140029963) -- but this time with no stops for shooting video, only a clean and fun ride down the mountains!

Regarding the photographic gear, this time I didn't bring with me the 50mm nor the Gorillapod tripod; the monopod is quick to setup and gives the right amount of extra stability that makes the difference from handheld filming. I still don't like how some footage turned out (too shaky) but you gotta compromise between ease of setup, quality of the shooting and personal fun (as I only have time for biking in the weekends, I want to *ride* also and not just do the amateur photo/videographer).

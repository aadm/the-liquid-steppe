This is probably one of the worst movie I've ever watched. It is so bad that I
actually enjoyed it. But the most incredible thing is that the three reviews
that I've read, well they're not so harsh on this piece of junk:

> Emma Bell, in particular, really sells the terror of their predicament (...) I
don’t think I’ve seen a movie this tense since The Descent.

(source: <http://www.filmjunk.com/2010/02/06/frozen-review>)

> (...) a nifty little chiller that balances its cold terrain with an
unexpectedly warm heart.

And if this is not enough, there's also the [Huffington Post's review](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marshall-fine/huffpost-review-ifrozeni_b_450620.html).

I have to say, it will be hard to trust NYT reviews from now on.

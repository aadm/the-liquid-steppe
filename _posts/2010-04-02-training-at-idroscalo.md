Training with my fixie at the Idroscalo. In the foreground, my red San Marco
Concor; back there, the mountains that you rarely see from this very polluted
and hazy city -- the Grigne. Training was: 15 series of friggin' fast spins
(around 100 rpm), 15" each, followed by 45" of slower pedaling. Well the idea
was this but since I had no speedometer, nothing to measure the number of
pedaling strokes per minute, and just one fuckin gear, I did what I could. I
hope it's effective (my legs were certainly feeling it).

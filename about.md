I have been calling myself aadm on the internet since forever. I have a very long name, and I have always wanted it to be much shorter. So that's why aadm.

Never been too sure about what's the point of me on this planet, but let's avoid philosophical blabbering and pretend the main thing I do here is photography. The amateurish kind.

However, this website also collects everything that I do and manage to write about. Mostly photography, yes, but also something about geosciences (the nerdy side of it), bicyces and my old two-wheeled love (motorbikes, but you gotta dig in the archives to find stuff).

I am originally from Southern Italy, and I have lived in London, Milano and now I am in Stavanger.

My family provides enough nourishment for my soul and body that everybody should kneel down and sing Gregorian chants right now.

I can be reached via Twitter, [@aadmtwi](http://twitter.com/aadmtwi), [Google+](http://plus.google.com/+AlessandroAmatodelMonte/) or through my [flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/), where I also collect my  photographs. I also have a randomly updated [instagram feed](http://instagram.com/aadm).

Please do not steal, manipulate or remix my photos, illustrations and content without my consent. You may link to the site and quote selected text only if you put a a link back to the original content. Re-publishing of complete posts or articles is not permitted.

If I put here something made by others I will clearly state it and never appropriate somebody else's work. I expect to be treated the same way.

If in doubt, ask me first: we may become friends.

Thanks for stopping by.
